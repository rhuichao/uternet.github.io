Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Scheme is a semi-functional programming language and a dialect of 
Lisp, which stands for LISt Processing<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot70"><SUP>1.1</SUP></A>. It is regarded as one of the most elegant 
programming languages in the world thanks  to its smallness, beauty and 
expressive power. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00310000000000000000">
The history of Scheme</A>
</H1>

<P>
Scheme saw the light of the world back in 1975 in the AI laboratory at MIT 
when Guy L. Steele and Gerald J. Sussman wanted to create a language that 
would own a clear and simple semantics. They had realized that languages 
should not be developed by adding a lot of features, but by removing 
weaknesses and limitations that make additional features seem necessary. Still,
Scheme is very expressive and supports several different programming paradigms.
Scheme was influenced by lambda calculus, which is one of the first functional
``programming languages'' in the world, Algol, from which Scheme inherited 
statical scope and Lisp, from which Scheme inherited the syntax. 

<P>
The development of Scheme has been very slow, since the people who standardize
Scheme are very conservative regarding adding new features. Quality has always
been more important than industrial usability and this has lead to the fact 
that Scheme is a very well designed general purpose programming language, which
does not contain a lot of kludges that would make the language clumsy. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00320000000000000000">
Scheme as a language</A>
</H1>

<P>
Scheme is a statically (= lexically) scoped and weakly typed programming 
language which is very well suited for transformational programming (that is, 
it is easy to write programs that write programs), scripting and for 
developing and implementing programming languages--among other things. Most of
the Scheme implementations are interactive (that is, interpreters), but there 
are also compilers available. 

<P>
The procedures in Scheme are first class procedures, which means that they can
be given as arguments to other procedures, they can be returned as the value of
a procedure, they can be bound to variables or fields of other objects etc. The
arguments of Scheme procedures are passed by value<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot73"><SUP>1.2</SUP></A>. 

<P>
Syntactically Scheme is very simple and beautiful. The syntax consists of 
parentheses and prefix notation, which means that the operator 
comes first and then the operands. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00330000000000000000">
Scheme in practice</A>
</H1>

<P>
Scheme is widely used in the academic world as an introductory language because
of its clear syntax, smallness and expressive power. The language is, however,
spreading into the industrial world too. Examples of the use of Scheme are 
Guile, which is an extension language developed by the Free Software 
Foundation,  scsh (the Scheme shell), which is a scripting language and CAD 
Framework Initiative, which partly uses Scheme. Scheme has also influenced 
other  programming languages, such as Common Lisp and Dylan. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00340000000000000000">
Why is Scheme good as an introductory language?</A>
</H1>

<P>
Scheme is a wonderful choice as an introductory language: its clear syntax 
makes it possible to concentrate on the programming problems at hand instead of
wasting a lot of time on teaching the syntax. It is also possible to teach 
several different programming paradigms, e.g. functional, imperative and 
object oriented. Scheme is also a very small language and is therefore easy to 
learn.
